# CornerGrocer

This was a project for one of my courses, it entails reading a list of grocery items and then creating a map of them with
their frequency and displaying it in different formats to the user.

I think my use of maps and multiple classes made this assignment smooth to work through and easy to read and work on further.

I think I could have utilized some pointers/aspects of classes more effectively but I think that this gets the job done.

Deciding how involved I wanted to make the food item class was tricky because I think if I was to work on this further
either for fun or another project I would want things to be even more object oriented and extendable.

Knowledge of taking information from files and mapping them in c++ syntax is good to know.

I think my use of object orientation and simple readable code made it easy to pick up where I left off from and if I needed to
I could get right back into it in the future
